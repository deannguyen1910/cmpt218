Context Switch: switch between processes for a task

Ready queue -> pass to CPU (if need input -> push to IO queue -> input queue) -> ready queue


preemptive scheduler


non preemptive scheduler: allo a process and hold it until it terminated 

Purpose: 
    maximize the CPU throughput
    minimize turn around time, wait time, response time
